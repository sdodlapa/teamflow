## 🔍 **DAILY PROGRESS TEMPLATE**

### **Day 1 Progress - September 25, 2025**
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Started**: 4:05 PM  
**Completed**: 8:45 PM

#### **✅ Completed Tasks**
- [x] Connected Login Component to `POST /api/v1/auth/login/json`
- [x] Connected Registration Component to `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- [x] Fixed authentication hanging issues (resolved database optimizer performance problem)
- [x] Cleaned up redundant authentication systems (archived 9 redundant files)
- [x] Validated JWT Token Management and API integration
- [x] Updated frontend authApi.ts for email-based authentication

#### **⚠️ Issues Encountered**
- **Authentication Hanging Issue**: All auth endpoints taking 5+ seconds due to database_optimizer.py SQLAlchemy event listeners. **Resolution**: Disabled performance monitoring causing the bottleneck.
- **Multiple Redundant Systems**: Found duplicate auth implementations (fast_auth.py, optimized_auth.py, database_v2.py). **Resolution**: Systematically archived redundant files with documentation.
- **Frontend-Backend Interface Mismatch**: Frontend expected email-based auth, backend had mixed implementations. **Resolution**: Standardized on email-based authentication via /auth/login/json.

#### **🎯 Success Criteria Met**
- [x] User can register new account (✅ Registration endpoint working ~50ms)
- [x] User can login with credentials (✅ Login endpoint working ~40ms)  
- [x] JWT token is stored and used for API calls (✅ Frontend authApi.ts configured)
- [x] Authentication system optimized and cleaned (✅ Redundant systems archived)

### **Day 2 Progress - September 25, 2025**
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Started**: 8:45 PM  
**Completed**: 9:30 PM

#### **✅ Completed Tasks**
- [x] Consolidated multiple AuthContext implementations into one robust system
- [x] Enhanced JWT Token Management with automatic refresh and expiration checking
- [x] Fixed persistent auth state with improved localStorage handling
- [x] Updated protected routes with correct authentication checks (PrivateRoute component)
- [x] Implemented automatic token refresh mechanism with 5-minute intervals
- [x] Consolidated user profile state management across all components
- [x] Fixed TypeScript interfaces to match backend API response structure
- [x] Cleaned up import conflicts and duplicate authentication systems

#### **⚠️ Issues Encountered**
- **Multiple AuthContext Implementations**: Found conflicting implementations in `contexts/` vs `context/` folders. **Resolution**: Consolidated into single comprehensive AuthContext with enhanced token management.
- **Import Path Conflicts**: Components referencing old useAuth hook paths. **Resolution**: Created backward-compatible useAuth hook that re-exports from AuthContext.
- **UserProfile Interface Mismatch**: Frontend expected `username` field but backend returns `name`/`full_name`. **Resolution**: Updated interface to match actual backend response structure.

#### **🎯 Success Criteria Met**
- [x] Authentication state persists across browser refresh (✅ Enhanced with localStorage)
- [x] JWT tokens are automatically refreshed before expiry (✅ 5-minute interval checks)
- [x] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated (✅ PrivateRoute working)
- [x] User profile data is available throughout the app (✅ Unified AuthContext)

#### **📝 Notes & Learnings**
- Consolidated authentication reduces complexity and prevents conflicts
- Automatic token refresh ensures seamless user experience
- Enhanced error handling and loading states improve UX
- TypeScript interfaces now match backend API responses exactly

#### **🔄 Next Day Preparation**
- [x] Frontend builds successfully with zero TypeScript errors
- [x] Authentication system is fully operational and tested
- [x] Ready to proceed to Day 3: Dashboard Integration
- [x] Backend and frontend servers both running smoothly
