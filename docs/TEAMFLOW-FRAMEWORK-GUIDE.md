### Implementation Process

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Week 1)
1. **Domain Analysis**
   - Identify core entities and relationships
   - Map existing TeamFlow concepts to new domain
   - Define business workflows and rules

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Database schema design
   - API endpoint specification
   - UI component requirements
   - Integration points

#### Phase 2: Backend Development (Week 2-3)
1. **Database Models**
   ```python
   # Extend BaseModel for domain entities
   class Vehicle(BaseModel):
       __tablename__ = "vehicles"
       vin = Column(String(17), unique=True)
       # ... domain-specific fields
   ```

2. **API Endpoints**
   ```python
   # Create domain-specific routes
   router = APIRouter(prefix="/fleet", tags=["Fleet"])
   
   @router.get("/vehicles")
   async def list_vehicles(...):
       # Domain logic here
   ```

3. **Business Logic Services**
   ```python
   class FleetService:
       @staticmethod
       async def get_fleet_dashboard(...):
           # Domain-specific business logic
   ```

#### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Week 3-4)
1. **React Components**
   ```typescript
   export const FleetDashboard: React.FC = () => {
       // Domain-specific UI components
   };
   ```

2. **Integration**
   - Connect to backend APIs
   - Implement domain workflows
   - Add navigation and routing

#### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
1. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for new models and services
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - E2E tests for user workflows

2. **Deployment**
   - Database migrations
   - Environment configuration
   - Production deployment

### Framework Usage Guide

#### 🚀 **Quick Start**
```bash
# 1. Use the framework generator
cd scripts
python framework_generator.py --domain "fleet_management"

# 2. Run the generated code
cd backend
make db-revision -m "Add fleet management"
make db-upgrade
make dev

# 3. Test the new functionality
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/fleet/vehicles
```
