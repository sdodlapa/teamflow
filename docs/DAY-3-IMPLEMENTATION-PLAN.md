## 🧠 **AI & AUTOMATION FEATURES**

### **Complexity Estimation Algorithm:**
```python
def calculate_task_complexity(task_data: dict) -> int:
    """AI-powered complexity scoring (1-10)"""
    base_score = 3
    
    # Description analysis
    description_length = len(task_data.get("description", ""))
    if description_length > 500: base_score += 2
    
    # Skill requirements
    skills_count = len(task_data.get("skills", []))
    base_score += min(skills_count, 3)
    
    # Dependencies
    dependencies_count = len(task_data.get("dependencies", []))
    base_score += min(dependencies_count, 2)
    
    # Historical similar tasks
    similar_tasks_avg = get_similar_tasks_complexity(task_data)
    base_score = (base_score + similar_tasks_avg) / 2
    
    return min(max(int(base_score), 1), 10)
```

### **Smart Assignment Algorithm:**
```python
def smart_task_assignment(task: Task, team_members: List[User]) -> User:
    """Intelligent task assignment based on multiple factors"""
    scores = {}
    
    for user in team_members:
        score = 0
        
        # Skill matching (40% weight)
        skill_match = calculate_skill_match(task.skill_requirements, user.skills)
        score += skill_match * 0.4
        
        # Current workload (30% weight)  
        workload_factor = calculate_workload_factor(user)
        score += (1 - workload_factor) * 0.3
        
        # Past performance (20% weight)
        performance_score = get_user_performance_score(user, task.complexity_score)
        score += performance_score * 0.2
        
        # Availability (10% weight)
        availability = check_user_availability(user)
        score += availability * 0.1
        
        scores[user.id] = score
    
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```
