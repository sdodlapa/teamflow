# 🧪 WEEK 23-26: TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE GUIDE
## Comprehensive Testing Framework & Quality Assurance

> **Priority 7 Implementation**: Complete testing coverage and QA automation  
> **Timeline**: 4 weeks  
> **Prerequisites**: Week 19-22 enterprise features complete  
> **Objective**: Achieve production-ready quality with comprehensive test coverage

## 📋 **TESTING FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW**

### **Current Testing State**
From existing system analysis:
- ✅ Backend unit tests (64 tests currently)
- ✅ Basic test fixtures and database setup
- ✅ API endpoint testing framework
- ✅ Load testing infrastructure (`load_tests/`)
- ⚠️ Frontend testing suite incomplete
- ⚠️ Integration testing gaps
- ⚠️ End-to-end testing missing
- ⚠️ Performance testing automation needed
